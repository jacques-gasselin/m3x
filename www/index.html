<h1>XML Tools for M3G</h1>

<p>This project is dedicated to providing reliable XML tools for M3G
(<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=184">JSR184</a>,
 <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=297">JSR297</a>).</p>

<p>The M3G XML Schema, M3X, is a new proposal for JSR297. We aim to make
a reference implementation of a reliable M3X to M3G converter using the M3X
Schema. A further goal would be to also allow M3G to M3X conversion.</p>

<p>These tools are mainly meant for developers and implementors of M3G.</p>

<ul>Some quick goals of the project:
    <li>Define an XML Schema that can validate .m3x files</li>
    <li>Use JAXB to create Marshalling facilities for .m3x files</li>
    <li>Create tools to convert .m3x to .m3g</li>
    <li>Create tools to convert .m3g to .m3x</li>
</ul>
