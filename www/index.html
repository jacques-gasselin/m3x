<h1>XML Tools for M3G</h1>
<p>This project is dedicated to providing reliable
XML tools for M3G (JSR184, JSR297).</p>
<p>The M3G XML Schema, M3X, is a new proposal for JSR297. We aim to make a
reference implementation of a reliable M3X to M3G converter using the M3X Schema.
A further goal would be to also allow M3G to M3X conversion.</p>
<p>These tools are mainly meant for developers and implementors of M3G.</p>

<ul>Some quick goals of the project:
    <li>Define an XML Schema that can validate .m3x files</li>
    <li>Use JAXB to create Marshalling facilities for .m3x files</li>
    <li>Create tools to convert .m3x to .m3g</li>
    <li>Create tools to convert .m3g to .m3x</li>
</ul>
