<h4>Contribute</h4>
<p>Development in the M3X project is collaborative with the ultimate goal of providing tools and APIs for all JSR184 and JSR297 users.
This lofty goal can be reached if users contribute code and ideas to the project. This may seem daunting, but even simple feedback like
a thank you will help. Code patches and build script improvements are always welcome.</p>

<p>Please note that patches may not always be approved. The core developers will do their best to explain in a concise manner the reasons for rejection.
Though depending on the nature of the patch that might not always be possible. Nevertheless your help is appreciated</p>

<ul>There are a few ways you can contribute:
  <li>Submit a bug report in the <a href="https://m3x.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue Tracker</a></li>
  <li>Subscribe to one or many of the <a href="https://m3x.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">mailing lists</a> and have your say.
  <ul>Choose the ones that most suit your purpose:
    <li><b>dev@m3x.dev.java.net</b> for patch committers and core developers.</li>
    <li><b>issues@m3x.dev.java.net</b> for following the issues in the tracker.</li>
    <li><b>ecosystem@m3x.dev.java.net</b> for discussing the broader scope of M3X, JSR184 and JSR297</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Join the project and edit the source directly. Commit privileges may not be granted until a user has contributed through other means. If this is your desire, please submit your changes as patches first. Such rights will only be granted by the current Benevolent Dictator.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Best Practises</h4>
<h5>Coding Standards</h5>
<p>When working with the source code always follow the coding standard. This is a requirement not an option. The standard is there to ensure all developers experience a uniform look to the source code. The coding standard is enforced in the build script using the excellent <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a> tool. Style errors are regarded as errors in the code and should not be committed to the
project unless in special circumstances (auto-generated code may sometimes violate this in an acceptable manner).</p>
 
<h5>Unit Testing</h5>
<p>Wherever possible automated Unit Testing should be used. The M3X project already has quite an extensive suite of tests, but we always need more. Patches submitted with a corresponding test will always take precedence to patches that require manual testing.</p>

<p>For all the JVM based code <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit 3+</a> compatible tests should be used. The build script runs JUnit in all the sub-projects
and any new tests should be added to those preexisting test suites if applicable.</p>
