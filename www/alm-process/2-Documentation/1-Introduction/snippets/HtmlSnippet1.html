<p>Development in the M3X project is collaborative with the ultimate goal of providing tools and APIs for all JSR184 and JSR297 users.
This lofty goal can be reached if users contribute code and ideas to the project. This may seem daunting, but even simple feedback like
a thank you will help. Code patches and build script improvements are always welcome.</p>

<p>Please note that patches may not always be approved. The core developers will do their best to explain in a concise manner the reasons for rejection.
Though depending on the nature of the patch that might not always be possible. Nevertheless your help is appreciated</p>
