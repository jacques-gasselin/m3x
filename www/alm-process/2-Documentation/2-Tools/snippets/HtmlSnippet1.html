<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><p>The M3X project includes some ANT tasks that are suited to being integrated in a build pipeline.</p>

<h4>M3X to Binary</h4>
<p>Probably the most important task that the M3X project, and by extension the xml format defined, provides.
This intends to be the easiest and least error prone way to convert source assets to JSR184 and JSR297 targeted assets.<p>

<p>To get this task working in your pipeline you need to follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the latest distribution of M3X. From it you will need the m3x.jar file.</li>
<li>Place the m3x.jar file in your project library folder, or somewhere where your script can access it. The rest of this
guide assumes that location is ${lib.dir}</li>
</ol>
