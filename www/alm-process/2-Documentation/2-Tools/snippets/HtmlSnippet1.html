<p>The M3X project includes some ANT tasks that are suited to being integrated in a build pipeline.</p>

<h4>M3X to Binary</h4>
<p>Probably the most important task that the M3X project, and by extension
    the xml format provides. This intends to be the easiest and least error prone
    way to convert source assets to JSR184 and JSR297 targeted assets.<p>

<p>To get this task working in your pipeline you need to follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Download the latest distribution of M3X. From it you will need the m3x.jar file.</li>
    <li>Place the m3x.jar file in your project library folder, or somewhere where
        your script can access it. The rest of this guide assumes that location is ${lib.dir}</li>
    <li>Place the m3x.jar file in your project library folder, or somewhere where
        your script can access it. The rest of this guide assumes that location is ${lib.dir}</li>
    <li>Also copy the JAXB implementation jar file, jaxb-impl.jar, from the distribution.
        Please note the license file that comes with it and ensure you agree to it before use.
        From the jaxb folder you will need the jaxb-impl.jar only.
        Hopefully this can be corrected in the future but due to the dynamic loading
        internally of the JAXB context (beyond our control) the taskdef below does not
        resolve all the references to JAXB. Put the jaxb-impl.jar in the same lib folder
        as m3x.jar, yet again assumed to be ${lib.dir}</li>
    <li>Add the following taskdef to your script:<br />
        <div style="background-color:#F8F8F8; color:#505050">
            <pre>
&lt;taskdef name="m3x_to_m3g"
         classname="m3x.translation.m3g.XmlToBinaryTask"&gt;
  &lt;classpath&gt;
    &lt;pathelement location="${lib.dir}/m3x.jar"/&gt;
  &lt;/classpath&gt;
&lt;/taskdef&gt;</pre>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>Use the task in your script at the appropriate place (in this example the
        files are assumed to be in the ${res.dir} location):
        <div style="background-color:#F8F8F8; color:#505050">
            <pre>
&lt;m3x_to_m3g&gt;
  &lt;classpath&gt;
    &lt;pathelement location="${lib.dir}/m3x.jar"/&gt;
    &lt;pathelement location="${lib.dir}/jaxb-impl.jar"/&gt;
  &lt;/classpath&gt;
  &lt;fileset dir="${res.dir}"&gt;
    &lt;include name="**/*.m3x"/&gt;
  &lt;/fileset&gt;
  &lt;mapper type="glob" from="*.m3x" to="*.m3g"/&gt;
&lt;/m3x_to_m3g&gt;</pre>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>That's it. The task uses up-to-date comparisons so you should be able to run
        the task often without slowing down your build.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Blender export script</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.blender.org">Blender</a> is an amazing open source
    3D DCC tool. Whilst the interface my be daunting to many newcomers the wide
    array of powerful features has ensured it has a vibrant community.
    Supporting Blender with M3X is a high priority and as such we have created
    an M3X exporter for it.</p>

<p>Currently the exporter is in an incomplete state, but static geometry, materials
    and lighting work quite well. For a more mature exporter please see Gerhard
    VÃ¶lkl's excellent <a href="http://www.nelson-games.de/bl2m3g/">m3g_export</a> script.

<p>To get the exporter installed you need to follow these steps</p>
<ol>
    <li>Work out the folder of your blender installation that is the correct
        place to put python scripts.
        <ul>
            <li>Mac and Linux: this is usually ~/.blender/scripts</li>
            <li>Windows XP: probably C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;Username&gt;\Application Data\Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts</li>
            <li>Windows Vista: probably C:\Users\&lt;Username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts</li>
        </ul>
        See the <a href="http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Manual/Extensions">
        Blender manual reference page on extensions</a> for more information.
    </li>
    <li>Copy the blender/m3x_export.py script from the M3X distribution to
        the Blender scripts location.</li>
    <li>Export to your hearts content.</li>
    <li>Report any bugs to the 
        <a href="https://m3x.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue Tracker</a>.
    </li>
</ol>
