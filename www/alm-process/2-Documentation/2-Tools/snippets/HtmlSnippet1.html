<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />                                <p>The M3X project includes some ANT tasks that are suited to being integrated in a build pipeline.</p>

<h4>M3X to Binary</h4>
<p>Probably the most important task that the M3X project, and by extension
   the xml format provides. This intends to be the easiest and least error prone
   way to convert source assets to JSR184 and JSR297 targeted assets.<p>

<p>To get this task working in your pipeline you need to follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Download the latest distribution of M3X. From it you will need the m3x.jar file.</li>
    <li>Place the m3x.jar file in your project library folder, or somewhere where
        your script can access it. The rest of this guide assumes that location is ${lib.dir}</li>
    <li>Place the m3x.jar file in your project library folder, or somewhere where
        your script can access it. The rest of this guide assumes that location is ${lib.dir}</li>
    <li>Also copy the JAXB implementation jar file, jaxb-impl.jar, from the distribution.
        Please note the license file that comes with it and ensure you agree to it before use.
        From the jaxb folder you will need the jaxb-impl.jar only.
        Hopefully this can be corrected in the future but due to the dynamic loading
        internally of the JAXB context (beyond our control) the taskdef below does not
        resolve all the references to JAXB. Put the jaxb-impl.jar in the same lib folder
        as m3x.jar, yet again assumed to be ${lib.dir}</li>
    <li>Add the following taskdef to your script:<br />
        <div style="color:#606060">
            <pre>
&lt;taskdef name="m3x_to_m3g"
         classname="m3x.translation.m3g.XmlToBinaryTask"&gt;
  &lt;classpath&gt;
    &lt;pathelement location="${lib.dir}/m3x.jar"/&gt;
  &lt;/classpath&gt;
&lt;/taskdef&gt;
            </pre>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>Use the task in your script at the appropriate place (in this example the
        files are assumed to be in the ${res.dir} location):
        <div style="color:#606060">
            <pre>
&lt;m3x_to_m3g&gt;
  &lt;classpath&gt;
    &lt;pathelement location="${lib.dir}/m3x.jar"/&gt;
    &lt;pathelement location="${lib.dir}/jaxb-impl.jar"/&gt;
  &lt;/classpath&gt;
  &lt;fileset dir="${res.dir}"&gt;
    &lt;include name="**/*.m3x"/&gt;
  &lt;/fileset&gt;
  &lt;mapper type="glob" from="*.m3x" to="*.m3g"/&gt;
&lt;/m3x_to_m3g&gt;
            </pre>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>That's it. The task uses up-to-date comparisons so you should be able to run
        the task often without slowing down your build.</li>
</ol>
