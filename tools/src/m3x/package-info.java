/**
 * <p>m3x is a collection of packages intended to create a dependable and cross-
 * platform solution for content creation and manipulation for the JSR184 and
 * JSR297 APIs.</p>
 *
 * <p>The JSR184 and JSR297 APIs describe an excellent binary format that is
 * uniform across all implementations. This is a large improvement on its older
 * sibling, Java3D. There is however no stipulation on how binary for the APIs
 * should be created. m3x intends to fill that gap in the specification.</p>
 *
 * <p>The mission of m3x includes the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>To create a human-readable, machine writable mapping of the JSR184 and JSR297
 * binary formats. This XML schema format is referred to as the m3x format.</li>
 * <li>To create dependable translations from popular DCC and game formats to
 * the m3x format.</li>
 * <li>To create an open-source work-alike implementation of JSR297 to allow quick
 * verification of format translations.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
