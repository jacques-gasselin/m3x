/**
 * <p>This collection of packages contains utilities for translating between
 * many different file formats and the m3x formats. The m3x formats are purpose
 * made for the JSR184 and JSR297 scene graph APIs. As such they are most
 * likely to appeal to mobile and embedded content creators.</p>
 *
 * <p>There exists a plethora of DCC tools and proprietary file formats out in
 * the wild. Some are designed for a specific purpose, whilst others are designed
 * to cater to every whim. Using and translating between these formats can often
 * be a daunting and time consuming task.</p>
 *
 * <p>The packages contained in this collection are driven by user requests and
 * so may not target everyones favourite format. If you would like to contribute
 * a translation of a format or just provide feedback; please go to the <a
 * href="https://m3x.dev.java.net/">m3x</a> homepage. There you can have a look
 * at the current progress and perhaps lodge a bug or feature request.
