    <p>The m3x package suite is intended to create a dependable and cross-
    platform solution for content creation and manipulation for the JSR184 and
    JSR297 APIs.</p>

    <p>The Mobiel 3D Grahpics APIs, JSR184 and JSR297, describe an excellent
    binary format that is uniform across all implementations. This is a large
    improvement on its older sibling, Java3D. There is however no stipulation
    on how binary data for the APIs should be created. The m3x suite intends
    to fill that gap in the specification.</p>

    <p>The mission of m3x includes the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>To create a human-readable, machine writable mapping of the JSR184 and JSR297
    binary formats. This XML schema format is referred to as the m3x format.</li>
    <li>To create dependable translations from popular DCC and game formats to
    the m3x format.</li>
    <li>To create an open-source work-alike implementation of JSR297 to allow quick
    verification of format translations.</li>
    </ul>
